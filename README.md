Code made to solve problems on Code-Wars!

This content is more a database to hold progress doing simple coding tasks. Wanted to showcase problems I have been solving for fun, stay in shape, and introduce new concepts in an applicable way. I have found that I learn best by trying to just explore, so I found Code-Wars to be perfectly incremental, but diverse to give me things that make me think!

If you are interested, please feel free to see what I have come up with so far!
